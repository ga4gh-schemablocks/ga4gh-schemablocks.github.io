   "description" : "A CURIE constitutes a \"Compact URI\" or Abbreviated syntax for expressing \nUniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). CURIEs consist of a prefix and a private \nID part, separated by a colon.\n\nSome design considerations:    \n\n* Prefixes should *not* be concatenated; there should only be a single colon \nin the CURIE.\n* While the underscore `_` character is considered a \"safe\" character in all \ncomputing environments and is a \"word character\" in regular expression \nmatching, it nevertheless should be _avoided_ as part of the private portion \nof a CURIE, since in some environments it has been used as replacement for \nthe prefix separation (in replacement for the colon character `:`).\n",
