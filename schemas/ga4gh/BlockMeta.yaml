  BlockMeta defines the format of the SchemaBlocks metadata, used to describe
  e.g. the given block's provenance, scope, external usage.
type: object
properties:
  contributors:

      The `contributors` attribute provides a list of one or more contributors
      which had been involved in the block's definition or support its format.

      The `provenance` attribute provides a list of pointers to e.g. external
      schemas, predecessors of the current schema or external documentation
      describing the schema's genesis.

  use_cases:
    description: |
      With the `use_cases` attribute one can provide links and descriptions
      for the use of a given block in an external implementation.
      This is not intended to provide a catalogue of all known implementations
      of the schema.

      With `sb_status` the current support level of the schema block inside
      the {S}[B] ecosystem has to be demonstrated. A first recommendation of
      levels is:

      * `playground`
        - early development or import stage, of any quality
        - no recommendation; existence does not mean any current or future
        {S}[B] support
      * `proposed`
        - at least some {S}[B] contributors are in favour of such a block
        - the code may undergo considerable maturation
        - not recommended for integration into products w/o close tracking
        - contributions and discussions are encouraged
      * `implementation`
        - mature block which is implemented in one or more {S}[B] aligned
        schemas
        - may be extended from a core block or be too specific for general
        ("core") usability
      * `core`
        - a schema block with recommended use
        - stable through minor version changes
        - has to be used in at least 2 approved / under review GA4GH products
