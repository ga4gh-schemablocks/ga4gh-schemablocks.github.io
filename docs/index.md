# GA4GH Data Standards, Conventions & Practices

This [website](http://genomestandards.org) from the GA4GH Communityrepresents information about data standards, computational conventions and procedures, "biodata" mappings and schema components which have found some consensus among GA4GH members or have been used in approved GA4GH standards. It does not aim to represent complete stand-alone standards such
as [VRS](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/), [Phenopackets](http://phenopackets.org) or
[Beacon](http://docs.genomebeacons.org) though parts or methods related to those
will contribute to the content of the site.

!!! warn "Non-authorative documentation"

    At this time the documents should __not__ be considered "__authoritative GA4GH
    recommendations__" and are not managed through the GA4GH TASC team. They rather
    represent prototype documentation and implementation examples contributed by
    GA4GH members. For more information on GA4GH, please visit the [GA4GH Website](https://ga4gh.org).
