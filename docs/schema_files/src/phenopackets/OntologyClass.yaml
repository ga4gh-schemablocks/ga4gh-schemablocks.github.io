title: OntologyClass
description: >-
  This element is used to represent classes (terms) from ontologies, and is used
  in many places throughout the Phenopacket standard. It is a simple, two element
  message that represents the identifier and the label of an ontology class.

  The ID SHALL be a CURIE-style identifier e.g. HP:0100024, MP:0001284,
  UBERON:0001690, i.e., the primary key for the ontology class. The label should
  be the corresponding class name. The Phenopacket standard REQUIRES that the id
  and the label match in the original ontology. We note that occasionally,
  ontology maintainers change the primary label of a term. (source: Phenopackets v2)
