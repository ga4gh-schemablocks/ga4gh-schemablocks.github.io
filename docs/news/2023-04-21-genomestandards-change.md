Based on the widespread interest of more general documentation of best practices
at GA4GH Connect April 2023 we're looking into a restart and reframing of previous
SchemaBlocks efforts into wider "genomic standards and use practices at GA4GH" concept.

Accordingly, the site has been split into 2 repositories where the direct schema
parts are accessible through this [ga4gh-schemablocks.github.io](http://ga4gh-schemablocks.github.io) 
site[^1] while the documentation of GA4GH "best practices" is now accessible under
the [ga4gh-community-standards.github.io](http://ga4gh-community-standards.github.io)
domain[^2]. While only a few recommendations are available there at this time
we encourage contributions from GA4GH members.
