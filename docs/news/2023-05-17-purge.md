Due to the split-off of the GA4GH "best practices" site (now accessible under
[ga4gh-community-standards.github.io](http://ga4gh-community-standards.github.io)[^1])
the remnants of the standards & practices documentation have been removed from
this {S}[B] site.

[^1]: The site is also available through [genomestandards.org](https://genomestandards.org)
