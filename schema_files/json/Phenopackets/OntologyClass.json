    "description": "This element is used to represent classes (terms) from ontologies, and is used in many places throughout the Phenopacket standard. It is a simple, two element message that represents the identifier and the label of an ontology class.\nThe ID SHALL be a CURIE-style identifier e.g. HP:0100024, MP:0001284, UBERON:0001690, i.e., the primary key for the ontology class. The label should be the corresponding class name. The Phenopacket standard REQUIRES that the id and the label match in the original ontology. We note that occasionally, ontology maintainers change the primary label of a term. (source: Phenopackets v2)",
