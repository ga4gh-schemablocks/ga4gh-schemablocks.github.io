## {{page.title}}

SchemaBlocks is a "__cross-workstreams, cross-drivers__" initiative to document GA4GH object standards and prototypes, as well as common data formats and semantics.

Launched in December 2018, this project is still in an "orientation phase", with developing participation, leadership and governance structures. At its current stage, the documents can __not__ be considered "__authoritative GA4GH recommendations__" but rather represent documentation and implementation examples provided by GA4GH members.

While future products and implementations may be completely based on _SchemaBlocks_ models, this project does not attempt to develop a rigid, complete data schema but rather to provide the object vocabulary and semantics for a large range of developments.

The SchemaBlocks site can be accessed though the permanent link [schemablocks.org](http://schemablocks.org). More information about the different products & formats can be found on the workstream sites. For reference, some of the original information about recommended formats and object hierarchies is kept in the [GA4GH Metadata repositories](https://ga4gh-metadata.github.io/SchemaBlocks/).
